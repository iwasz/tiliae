* Build and install
I have never tried to compile the whole thing under other operating system other than Linux (particularly Ubuntu). Under Linux, the thing goes as follows:

1. Install cmake build system:
#apt-get install cmake

2. Install required libraries (i.e. their development versions). That would be boost >= 1.41 and libxml2:
#apt-get install libxml2-dev libboost-dev

(I personally prefer to use the newest libboost compiled from sources).

3. Compile and install :
$cd tiliae/build
$cmake .
$make
# go make some coffee here, or add -j switch to make

And optionally : 
#make install

* How to use.
As for now, there is almost no documentation except some comments in source files, but majority of them is in Polish, 
so they are of no use for most of you. I'll try to update it to English, and maybe make some nice tutorial. Also there 
are quite many unit tests which are also good source of examples. Most descriptive (and advanced) tests are located in 
tiliae/base/container/inputFormat/xml/test.
